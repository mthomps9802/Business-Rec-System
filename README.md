# Business-Rec-System

Business Recommendation system based on the yelp dataset using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

It is specifically using the business.json and is only reading 10000 lines

For the second set of additions I'm extending part 1 to display a category (cluster) and most similar key from the data structures after creating a persistent block-based extensible hash table that maps businesses to their representation file names



Any feedback on how to improve it would be greatly appreciated
